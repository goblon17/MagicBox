# MagicBox

An audio-mixer with mic input and bluetooth receiver.

### Motivation
I created this device for cheap mobile karaoke setup. I am using potential subpar solutions as I am no electronic engineer. This project is something that will work just "good enough" (f-off audiophiles, i don't have some $5k just lying around).

### Sections
There are multiple sections that make up this device. They are put onto seperate boeards that could be disconnected depending on the final design.
- Mic preamp
- Mic echo
- Bluetooth receiver
- Mixer board

Mic preamp is configured to support standard PC 3.5 mm jack microphone.
